<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I took up a summer research internship on Analysing the Effect of Radiation on Devices with Prof. Joycee Mekie. </p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- I carried out simulations in Cadence Virtuoso, using SKILL and Python Script. 
</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- I examined the 65nm fabrication technology gates and recognized the minimum current required for a single event transient to be generated at a node.</p>
 <p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- Through these simulation experiments, I observed that gates with certain complexities require a similar amount of excitation current for a single event transient to be latched to its circuit. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- This helped me understand the influence of the size and complexity of a gate on its susceptibility to radiation. </p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- We then identified the transistors in the gates which are most susceptible and resized them in order to make the circuit radiation hardened with minimal increase in area and cost.
