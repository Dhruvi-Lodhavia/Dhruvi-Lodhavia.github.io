I worked with Prof. Joycee Mekie on Radiation Hardening
for Space Applications. A major challenge to the electronic circuits used in space applications is soft
errors generated due to the bombardment of a charged particle on a circuit node. In a group of two, </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- We proposed a cost-effective radiation hardening technique to increase the soft-error resilience of the circuit.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- We leveraged asymmetrical propagation of the transient across the gates of a circuit due to logical
and electrical masking. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- We then resized the gates with the highest susceptibility of transmitting soft
error thereby making the circuit fault-tolerant. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- To identify such nodes, we developed a model using the
netlist generated from ISCAS’85 benchmark circuits using Synopsys Design Compiler. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- Further, we tested the developed model using Cadence Virtuoso to recognize the importance of non-ideal characteristics
which were missed while modeling. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- Later, these discrepancies were appreciated by parsing through the technology’s library file and analyzing capacitance and delay values. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Finally, we successfully estimated
changes in the width of the transient. </p>
