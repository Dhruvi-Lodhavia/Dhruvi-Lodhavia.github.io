<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
As a part of my VLSI course, I worked on implementing a 4T dual Embedded DRAM array (EDRAM) for in-memory computation of DNNs. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- I understood the basics such as leakages present in MOSFETs,
calculating the static and dynamic power consumption of circuits, and making layouts for circuits in
Cadence Virtuoso. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- This project helped me learn power, area, and latency trade-offs. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- I also learnt to
perform Monte Carlo simulations to model the stochasticity, mismatching, and process variation of a 2T
EDRAM cell. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- I was able to increase the retention time from 2μs in reference paper to 55μs at a cost of
65% increase in energy per operation.</p>
