I took up a summer research internship on Analysing the Effect of Radiation on Devices with Prof. Joycee Mekie. Simulations were carried out on Cadence Virtuoso, using SKILL and Python Script. I examined the 65nm fabrication technology gates and recognized the minimum current required for a single event transient to be generated at a node. Through these simulation experiments, I observed that gates with certain complexities require a similar amount of excitation current for a single event transient to be latched to its circuit. This helped me understand the influence of the size and complexity of a gate on its susceptibility to radiation. We then identified the transistors in the gates which are most susceptible and resized them in order to make the circuit radiation hardened with minimal increase in area and cost
