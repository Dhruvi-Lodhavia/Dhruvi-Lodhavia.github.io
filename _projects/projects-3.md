During my 7th semester, I worked with Prof. Nipun Batra in ubiquitous computing and worked on
retrofitting a consumer-grade mask with sensors that can measure and predict the lung health of an
individual using Machine Learning. Presently, around 235 million people suffer from respiratory illnesses.
Lung diagnosis is typically missed or delayed until poor lung health conditions advance. By using a
microphone, we worked on continuously monitoring the lung health of a user without any additional
instruments or doctor visits. </p>

We submitted this work at ACM Transaction on Computing for HealthCare
which is presently under review. I was the second author of this paper and majorly contributed to 
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
- building
an improvised pipeline for respiration monitoring and detection, improving the accuracy of classification
of tidal breathing from speech and noise, and reducing the error in peak detection at lower sampling
rates. This reduced error and improved accuracy at lower sampling rates eliminated privacy concerns as
speech is unintelligible at these rates.

- worked on low power sensing and performed real-world human
study to obtain samples for our work.

- assisted Prof. Nipun Batra in writing a grant for retrofitting
everyday objects for continuous health sensing for USD 50,000 to Sony Research.
