- Improved the tidal breathing pipeline to get a MAE of 0.5 in peak detection and got an accuracy of 94.7% in classifying tidal
breathing, noise and speech
- Performed power profiling of the battery and employed power saving methods to increase the battery life of the sensor used for
monitoring breathing
- Designed an experiment to collect tidal breathing samples while walking for participants in a study
